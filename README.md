<h1> CSS/JS Carousel </h1>
  
In the context of JavaScript and web development, a carousel refers to a dynamic component or widget that displays a set of images or content in a rotating or sliding fashion. Also known as an image slider or image gallery, a carousel allows users to navigate through a collection of images or other types of content in a visually appealing and interactive manner.

A JavaScript carousel typically consists of several key components:

<b>Container:</b> The container holds the carousel and sets the overall dimensions and layout of the carousel.
Slides: Each slide represents a single item in the carousel, such as an image or a piece of content. Slides are displayed one at a time, occupying the visible area within the carousel.

<b>Navigation Controls: (NOT INCLUDED YET)</b> These controls allow users to move between slides, typically through buttons or indicators that indicate the current slide and provide options to navigate to previous or next slides.
  
<b>Transition Effects:</b> Transition effects define the visual animation when moving between slides. Common effects include sliding, fading, or zooming.
  
<b>Autoplay:</b> Carousels often provide an autoplay feature, allowing the slides to automatically transition at regular intervals without user interaction.
  
JavaScript is used to handle the logic and interactivity of the carousel. It enables functionality such as slide navigation, autoplay behavior, and applying transition effects. Additionally, CSS is employed to style the carousel and its elements, defining the visual appearance and layout.

Carousels are widely used in web design to showcase images, highlight featured content, or provide a visually engaging way to present information. They offer an intuitive and interactive user experience, enabling users to explore a collection of content within a confined space.
